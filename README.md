## 👋 Hi, I’m Zakaria but you can call me Zak
*Also known by @Shyrro in social media.*

I love FrontEnd Development. My efforts are mostly going towards [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) 💚 and [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) 🔥 .

I also give a special care to accessibility ♿ and automated testing 🧪. 

I'm curious in general and i like to know what's happening outside of the frameworks i chose. That is why, my jobs are mostly with React ⚛️. 
I do think that every idea is worth taking, it just needs to be in the right place at the right time. 

I also used to teach VueJS in a French University in Lille.
